The project contains the companion code to paper "Selecting the Most Conflicting
Pair of Candidates" by [Théo Delemazure](https://theo.delemazure.fr), Łukasz
Janeczko, [Andrzej Kaczmarczyk](https://akaczmarczyk.com), and [Stanisław
Szufa](https://szufa.simple.ink).

The files contain:
 - jupyter notebooks with the code used to generate the figures
 - the python package we implemented, in directory `cvrpy`
 - the datasets we used, in directory `datasets` 
 - raw data of our experiments, in directory `data_out`

> ❗ No data was collected in the course of this project. All used datasets come
from external sources. Namely, the French presidential election data comes from
the [Voter autrement 2017 - online
experiment](https://zenodo.org/records/1199545) and the [Voter autrement 2022 -
online experiment](https://zenodo.org/records/10998451), while the
[sushi](https://preflib.simonrey.fr/dataset/00014) and [skating
competition](https://preflib.simonrey.fr/dataset/00006) datasets come from
[Preflib](https://preflib.simonrey.fr).
