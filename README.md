The project contains the companion code to paper "Selecting the Most Conflicting
Pair of Candidates" by [Théo Delemazure](https://theo.delemazure.fr), Łukasz
Janeczko, [Andrzej Kaczmarczyk](https://akaczmarczyk.com), and [Stanisław
Szufa](https://szufa.simple.ink).


The _cvrpy_ directory contains the python package we implemented, while the
notebooks contains the code used to generate the figures. We also provide the
datasets we used as well as raw data of our experiments.

> ❗ No data was collected in the course of this project. All our datasets come
from external sources. Namely, the French presidential election data come from
the [Voter autrement 2017 - online
experimen](https://zenodo.org/records/1199545) and [Voter autrement 2022 -
online experimen](https://zenodo.org/records/10998451), while the
[sushi](https://preflib.simonrey.fr/dataset/00014) and [skating
competition](https://preflib.simonrey.fr/dataset/00006) data comes from
[Preflib](https://preflib.simonrey.fr).
